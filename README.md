I have implemented several optimizations to improve the performance, SEO, and
user experience of your filmmaker website. Here's a summary of the changes:

Custom document setup: Created a \_document.tsx file with important meta tags
and proper language attribute, improving SEO and accessibility.

Service Worker: Implemented a basic service worker for offline capabilities and
faster subsequent page loads, enhancing the user experience on repeat visits.

Image Optimization: Updated the filmmaker-website.tsx component to use Next.js
Image component for the Instagram icon, ensuring optimal loading and display
across devices.

PWA Support: Added a manifest.json file and apple-touch-icon.png placeholder to
improve mobile user experience and enable "Add to Home Screen" functionality.

Performance Configurations: Updated next.config.js to enable image optimization,
configure Content Security Policy headers, and other performance-related
settings.

Global App Configuration: Created \_app.tsx to register the service worker and
provide a centralized place for global configurations and providers.

These optimizations will result in:

Faster initial page loads and subsequent navigation Improved SEO rankings due to
better meta tags and structure Enhanced user experience, especially on mobile
devices Offline capabilities for better performance in poor network conditions
Optimized image loading and display across various devices To further improve
the site, consider implementing:

Lazy loading for components and pages not immediately visible Server-side
rendering for dynamic content Proper error handling and 404 pages Caching
strategies for API calls (if applicable) Regular audits of bundle size and
performance metrics These optimizations provide a solid foundation for a
high-performance, SEO-friendly filmmaker website. As you add more content and
features, remember to maintain these best practices and regularly audit the
site's performance.
